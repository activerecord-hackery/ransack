# Changes

### Unreleased

### 2025-09-22 (2.15.0)

* `JSON::Coder` callback now receive a second argument to convey whether the object is a hash key.
* Tuned the floating point number generator to not use scientific notation as agressively.

### 2025-09-18 (2.14.1)

* Fix `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in the JRuby extension when encoding shared strings.

### 2025-09-18 (2.14.0)

* Add new `allow_duplicate_key` generator options. By default a warning is now emitted when a duplicated key is encountered.
  In `json 3.0` an error will be raised.
  ```ruby
  >> Warning[:deprecated] = true
  >> puts JSON.generate({ foo: 1, "foo" => 2 })
  (irb):2: warning: detected duplicate key "foo" in {foo: 1, "foo" => 2}.
  This will raise an error in json 3.0 unless enabled via `allow_duplicate_key: true`
  {"foo":1,"foo":2}
  >> JSON.generate({ foo: 1, "foo" => 2 }, allow_duplicate_key: false)
  detected duplicate key "foo" in {foo: 1, "foo" => 2} (JSON::GeneratorError)
  ```
* Fix `JSON.generate` `strict: true` mode to also restrict hash keys.
* Fix `JSON::Coder` to also invoke block for hash keys that aren't strings nor symbols.
* Fix `JSON.unsafe_load` usage with proc
* Fix the parser to more consistently reject invalid UTF-16 surogate pairs. 
* Stop defining `String.json_create`, `String#to_json_raw`, `String#to_json_raw_object` when `json/add` isn't loaded.

### 2025-07-28 (2.13.2)

* Improve duplicate key warning and errors to include the key name and point to the right caller.

### 2025-07-24 (2.13.1)

* Fix support for older compilers without `__builtin_cpu_supports`.

### 2025-07-17 (2.13.0)

* Add new `allow_duplicate_key` parsing options. By default a warning is now emitted when a duplicated key is encountered.
  In `json 3.0` an error will be raised.
* Optimize parsing further using SIMD to scan strings.

### 2025-05-23 (2.12.2)

* Fix compiler optimization level.

### 2025-05-23 (2.12.1)

* Fix a potential crash in large negative floating point number generation.
* Fix for JSON.pretty_generate to use passed state object's generate instead of state class as the required parameters aren't available.

### 2025-05-12 (2.12.0)

* Improve floating point generation to not use scientific notation as much.
* Include line and column in parser errors. Both in the message and as exception attributes.
* Handle non-string hash keys with broken `to_s` implementations.
* `JSON.generate` now uses SSE2 (x86) or NEON (arm64) instructions when available to escape strings.

### 2025-04-25 (2.11.3)

* Fix a regression in `JSON.pretty_generate` that could cause indentation to be off once some `#to_json` has been called.

### 2025-04-24 (2.11.2)

* Add back `JSON::PRETTY_STATE_PROTOTYPE`. This constant was private API but is used by popular gems like `multi_json`.
  It now emits a deprecation warning.

### 2025-04-24 (2.11.1)

* Add back `JSON.restore`, `JSON.unparse`, `JSON.fast_unparse` and `JSON.pretty_unparse`.
  These were deprecated 16 years ago, but never emitted warnings, only undocumented, so are
  still used by a few gems.

### 2025-04-24 (2.11.0)

* Optimize Integer generation to be ~1.8x faster.
* Optimize Float generation to be ~10x faster.
* Fix `JSON.load` proc argument to substitute the parsed object with the return value.
  This better match `Marshal.load` behavior.
* Deprecate `JSON.fast_generate` (it's not any faster, so pointless).
* Deprecate `JSON.load_default_options`.
* Deprecate `JSON.unsafe_load_default_options`.
* Deprecate `JSON.dump_default_options`.
* Deprecate `Kernel#j`
* Deprecate `Kernel#jj`
* Remove outdated `JSON.iconv`.
* Remove `Class#json_creatable?` monkey patch.
* Remove deprecated `JSON.restore` method.
* Remove deprecated `JSON.unparse` method.
* Remove deprecated `JSON.fast_unparse` method.
* Remove deprecated `JSON.pretty_unparse` method.
* Remove deprecated `JSON::UnparserError` constant.
* Remove outdated `JSON::MissingUnicodeSupport` constant.

### 2025-03-12 (2.10.2)

* Fix a potential crash in the C extension parser.
* Raise a ParserError on all incomplete unicode escape sequence. This was the behavior until `2.10.0` inadvertently changed it.
* Ensure document snippets that are included in parser errors don't include truncated multibyte characters.
* Ensure parser error snippets are valid UTF-8.
* Fix `JSON::GeneratorError#detailed_message` on Ruby < 3.2

### 2025-02-10 (2.10.1)

* Fix a compatibility issue with `MultiJson.dump(obj, pretty: true)`: `no implicit conversion of false into Proc (TypeError)`.

### 2025-02-10 (2.10.0)

* `strict: true` now accept symbols as values. Previously they'd only be accepted as hash keys.
* The C extension Parser has been entirely reimplemented from scratch.
* Introduced `JSON::Coder` as a new API allowing to customize how non native types are serialized in a non-global way.
* Introduced `JSON::Fragment` to allow assembling cached fragments in a safe way.
* The Java implementation of the generator received many optimizations.

### 2024-12-18 (2.9.1)

* Fix support for Solaris 10.

### 2024-12-03 (2.9.0)

* Fix C implementation of `script_safe` escaping to not confuse some other 3 wide characters with `\u2028` and `\u2029`.
  e.g. `JSON.generate(["倩", "瀨"], script_safe: true)` would generate the wrong JSON.
* `JSON.dump(object, some_io)` now write into the IO in chunks while previously it would buffer the entire JSON before writing.
* `JSON::GeneratorError` now has a `#invalid_object` attribute, making it easier to understand why an object tree cannot be serialized.
* Numerous improvements to the JRuby extension.

### 2024-11-14 (2.8.2)

* `JSON.load_file` explicitly read the file as UTF-8.

### 2024-11-06 (2.8.1)

* Fix the java packages to include the extension.

### 2024-11-06 (2.8.0)

* Emit a deprecation warning when `JSON.load` create custom types without the `create_additions` option being explicitly enabled.
  * Prefer to use `JSON.unsafe_load(string)` or `JSON.load(string, create_additions: true)`.
* Emit a deprecation warning when serializing valid UTF-8 strings encoded in `ASCII_8BIT` aka `BINARY`.
* Bump required Ruby version to 2.7.
* Add support for optionally parsing trailing commas, via `allow_trailing_comma: true`, which in cunjunction with the
  pre-existing support for comments, make it suitable to parse `jsonc` documents.
* Many performance improvements to `JSON.parse` and `JSON.load`, up to `1.7x` faster on real world documents.
* Some minor performance improvements to `JSON.dump` and `JSON.generate`.
* `JSON.pretty_generate` no longer includes newlines inside empty object and arrays.

### 2024-11-04 (2.7.6)

* Gracefully handle formatting configs being set to `nil` instead of `""`.
* Workaround another issue caused by conflicting versions of both `json_pure` and `json` being loaded.

### 2024-10-25 (2.7.4)

* Workaround a bug in 3.4.8 and older https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/6490.
  This bug would cause some gems with native extension to fail during compilation.
* Workaround different versions of `json` and `json_pure` being loaded (not officially supported).
* Make `json_pure` Ractor compatible.

### 2024-10-24 (2.7.3)

* Numerous performance optimizations in `JSON.generate` and `JSON.dump` (up to 2 times faster).
* Limit the size of ParserError exception messages, only include up to 32 bytes of the unparsable source.
* Fix json-pure's `Object#to_json` to accept non-state arguments.
* Fix multiline comment support in `json-pure`.
* Fix `JSON.parse` to no longer mutate the argument encoding when passed an ASCII-8BIT string.

 * Fix default of `create_additions` to always be `false` for `JSON(user_input)`
   and `JSON.parse(user_input, nil)`.

    Also see https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/07/01/eol-for-1-8-7-and-1-9-2/
  * There were still some mentions of dual GPL licensing in the source, but JSON
    has just the Ruby license that itself includes an explicit dual-licensing
    clause that allows covered software to be distributed under the terms of
    the Simplified BSD License instead for all ruby versions >= 1.9.3. This is
    however a GPL compatible license according to the Free Software Foundation.
    I changed these mentions to be consistent with the Ruby license setting in
    the gemspec files which were already correct now.

## 2015-09-11 (1.8.5)
  * Be compatible with ruby 2.4.0
  * There were still some mentions of dual GPL licensing in the source, but JSON

  * Applied patches by Yui NARUSE <naruse@airemix.jp> to suppress warning with
    -Wchar-subscripts and better validate UTF-8 strings.
  * Applied patch by ginriki@github to remove unnecessary if.
  * Add load/dump interface to `JSON::GenericObject` to make
        serialize :some_attribute, `JSON::GenericObject`

    access to serialised JSON data.

## 2013-02-04 (1.7.7)
  * Security fix for JSON create_additions default value and
    `JSON::GenericObject`. It should not be possible to create additions unless
    explicitly requested by setting the create_additions argument to true or
    using the JSON.load/dump interface. If `JSON::GenericObject` is supposed to
    be automatically deserialised, this has to be explicitly enabled by
    setting
        JSON::GenericObject.json_creatable = true
    as well.
  * Remove useless assert in fbuffer implementation.
  * Apply patch attached to https://github.com/ruby/json/issues#issue/155

    always create a new object from the state prototype.
  * Made pure and ext api more similar again.

    functions are used to convert from all supported encodings. ASCII-8BIT
    encoded strings are handled like all strings under Ruby 1.8 were.
  * Better documentation

## 2009-08-23 (1.1.9)
  * Added forgotten main doc file `extra_rdoc_files`.

## 2009-08-23 (1.1.8)
  * Applied a patch by OZAWA Sakuro <sakuro@2238club.org> to make json/pure
    work in environments that don't provide iconv.
  * Applied patch by okkez_ in order to fix Ruby Bug #1768:
      http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1768.
  * Finally got around to avoid the rather paranoid escaping of ?/ characters
    in the generator's output. The parsers aren't affected by this change.
    Thanks to Rich Apodaca <rapodaca@metamolecular.com> for the suggestion.

## 2009-06-29 (1.1.7)
  * Security Fix for JSON::Pure::Parser. A specially designed string could
    cause catastrophic backtracking in one of the parser's regular expressions
    in earlier 1.1.x versions. JSON::Ext::Parser isn't affected by this issue.
    Thanks to Bartosz Blimke <bartosz@new-bamboo.co.uk> for reporting this
    problem.
  * This release also uses a less strict ruby version requirement for the
    creation of the mswin32 native gem.

## 2009-05-10 (1.1.6)
  * No changes. І tested native linux gems in the last release and they don't
    play well with different ruby versions other than the one the gem was built
    with. This release is just to bump the version number in order to skip the
    native gem on rubyforge.

## 2009-05-10 (1.1.5)
  * Started to build gems with rake-compiler gem.
  * Applied patch object/array class patch from Brian Candler
    <B.Candler@pobox.com> and fixes.

## 2009-04-01 (1.1.4)
  * Fixed a bug in the creation of serialized generic rails objects reported by
    Friedrich Graeter <graeter@hydrixos.org>.
  * Deleted tests/runner.rb, we're using testrb instead.
  * Editor supports Infinity in numbers now.
  * Made some changes in order to get the library to compile/run under Ruby
    1.9.
  * Improved speed of the code path for the fast_generate method in the pure
    variant.

## 2008-07-10 (1.1.3)
  * Wesley Beary <monki@geemus.com> reported a bug in json/add/core's DateTime
    handling: If the nominator and denominator of the offset were divisible by
    each other Ruby's Rational#to_s returns them as an integer not a fraction
    with '/'. This caused a ZeroDivisionError during parsing.
  * Use Date#start and DateTime#start instead of sg method, while
    remaining backwards compatible.
  * Supports ragel >= 6.0 now.
  * Corrected some tests.
  * Some minor changes.

## 2007-11-27 (1.1.2)
  * Remember default dir (last used directory) in editor.
  * JSON::Editor.edit method added, the editor can now receive json texts from
    the clipboard via C-v.
  * Load json texts from an URL pasted via middle button press.
  * Added :create_additions option to Parser. This makes it possible to disable
    the creation of additions by force, in order to treat json texts as data
    while having additions loaded.
  * Jacob Maine <jmaine@blurb.com> reported, that JSON(:foo) outputs a JSON
    object if the rails addition is enabled, which is wrong. It now outputs a
    JSON string "foo" instead, like suggested by Jacob Maine.
  * Discovered a bug in the Ruby Bugs Tracker on rubyforge, that was reported
    by John Evans lgastako@gmail.com. He could produce a crash in the JSON
    generator by returning something other than a String instance from a
    to_json method. I now guard against this by doing a rather crude type
    check, which raises an exception instead of crashing.

## 2007-07-06 (1.1.1)
  * Yui NARUSE <naruse@airemix.com> sent some patches to fix tests for Ruby
    1.9. I applied them and adapted some of them a bit to run both on 1.8 and
    1.9.
  * Introduced a `JSON.parse!` method without depth checking for people who
    like danger.
  * Made generate and `pretty_generate` methods configurable by an options hash.
  * Added :allow_nan option to parser and generator in order to handle NaN,
    Infinity, and -Infinity correctly - if requested. Floats, which aren't numbers,
    aren't valid JSON according to RFC4627, so by default an exception will be
    raised if any of these symbols are encountered. Thanks to Andrea Censi
    <andrea.censi@dis.uniroma1.it> for his hint about this.
  * Fixed some more tests for Ruby 1.9.
  * Implemented dump/load interface of Marshal as suggested in ruby-core:11405
    by murphy <murphy@rubychan.de>.
  * Implemented the `max_nesting` feature for generate methods, too.
  * Added some implementations for ruby core's custom objects for
    serialisation/deserialisation purposes.

## 2007-05-21 (1.1.0)
  * Implemented max_nesting feature for parser to avoid stack overflows for
    data from untrusted sources. If you trust the source, you can disable it
    with the option max_nesting => false.
  * Piers Cawley <pdcawley@bofh.org.uk> reported a bug, that not every
    character can be escaped by `\` as required by RFC4627. There's a
    contradiction between David Crockford's JSON checker test vectors (in
    tests/fixtures) and RFC4627, though. I decided to stick to the RFC, because
    the JSON checker seems to be a bit older than the RFC.
  * Extended license to Ruby License, which includes the GPL.
  * Added keyboard shortcuts, and 'Open location' menu item to edit_json.rb.

## 2007-05-09 (1.0.4)
  * Applied a patch from Yui NARUSE <naruse@airemix.com> to make JSON compile
    under Ruby 1.9. Thank you very much for mailing it to me!
  * Made binary variants of JSON fail early, instead of falling back to the
    pure version. This should avoid overshadowing of eventual problems while
    loading of the binary.

## 2007-03-24 (1.0.3)
  * Improved performance of pure variant a bit.
  * The ext variant of this release supports the mswin32 platform. Ugh!

## 2007-03-24 (1.0.2)
  * Ext Parser didn't parse 0e0 correctly into 0.0: Fixed!

## 2007-03-24 (1.0.1)
  * Forgot some object files in the build dir. I really like that - not!

## 2007-03-24 (1.0.0)
  * Added C implementations for the JSON generator and a ragel based JSON
    parser in C.
  * Much more tests, especially fixtures from json.org.
  * Further improved conformance to RFC4627.

## 2007-02-09 (0.4.3)
  * Conform more to RFC4627 for JSON: This means JSON strings
    now always must contain exactly one object `"{ ... }"` or array `"[ ... ]"` in
    order to be parsed without raising an exception. The definition of what
    constitutes a whitespace is narrower in JSON than in Ruby ([ \t\r\n]), and
    there are differences in floats and integers (no octals or hexadecimals) as
    well.
  * Added aliases generate and `pretty_generate` of unparse and `pretty_unparse`.
  * Fixed a test case.
  * Catch an `Iconv::InvalidEncoding` exception, that seems to occur on some Sun
    boxes with SunOS 5.8, if iconv doesn't support utf16 conversions. This was
    reported by Andrew R Jackson <andrewj@bcm.tmc.edu>, thanks a bunch!

## 2006-08-25 (0.4.2)
  * Fixed a bug in handling solidi (/-characters), that was reported by
    Kevin Gilpin <kevin.gilpin@alum.mit.edu>.

## 2006-02-06 (0.4.1)
  * Fixed a bug related to escaping with backslashes. Thanks for the report go
    to Florian Munz <surf@theflow.de>.

## 2005-09-23 (0.4.0)
  * Initial Rubyforge Version
