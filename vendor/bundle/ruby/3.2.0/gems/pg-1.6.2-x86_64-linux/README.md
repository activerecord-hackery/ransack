## Description

Pg is the Ruby interface to the [PostgreSQL RDBMS](http://www.postgresql.org/).
It works with [PostgreSQL 10 and later](http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

A small example usage:
```ruby
  #!/usr/bin/env ruby

  require 'pg'

  # Output a table of current connections to the DB
  conn = PG.connect( dbname: 'sales' )
  conn.exec( "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity" ) do |result|
    puts "     PID | User             | Query"
    result.each do |row|
      puts " %7d | %-16s | %s " %
        row.values_at('pid', 'usename', 'query')
    end
  end
```

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.7 or newer
* PostgreSQL 10.x or later
* When installing the source gem: libpq with headers, -dev packages, etc.


## How To Install

Install via RubyGems:

    gem install pg

This installs the binary gem, specific to the running platform by default.

### Binary gem

The binary gems don't depend on the libpq package on the running system.
They have libpq builtin.

The gems for platform `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux` run on Alpine Linux, but require the package `gcompat`, while the native gems for platform `*-linux-musl` work without that dependency.

There is one use case the binary gems don't support: Retrieval of connection [options from LDAP](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ldap.html). To support this `libldap` would be necessary, but it has a lot of dependencies. It doesn't seem to be a widely used feature and that it's worth to support it. If it's necessary, the source gem can be forced.

### Source gem

The source gem can be forced by:

    gem uninstall pg --all
    gem install pg --platform ruby

You may need to specify the path to the 'pg_config' program installed with
Postgres:

    gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=<path to pg_config>

If you're installing via Bundler, you can provide compile hints like so:

    bundle config build.pg --with-pg-config=<path to pg_config>

### Bundler

To make sure, the necessary platforms and the source gem are fetched by bundler, they can be added like so

```
bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
bundle lock --add-platform arm64-darwin
bundle lock --add-platform x64-mingw-ucrt
bundle lock --add-platform ruby
bundle package --all-platforms
```

A re-run of `bundle package` is also necessary after `bundle update`, in order to retrieve the new specific gems of all platforms.

If the binary gems don't work for some reason, it's easy to force the usage of the source gem in the Gemfile:

```
gem "pg", force_ruby_platform: true
```

### More

See README-OS_X.rdoc for more information about installing under MacOS X, and
README-Windows.rdoc for Windows build/installation instructions.

There's also [a Google+ group](http://goo.gl/TFy1U) and a
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-pg) if you get stuck, or just
want to chat about something.

If you want to install as a signed gem, the public certs of the gem signers
can be found in [the `certs` directory](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/tree/master/certs)
of the repository.


## Versioning

We tag and release gems according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) principle.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint](http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#pessimistic-version-constraint) with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
  spec.add_dependency 'pg', '~> 1.0'
```


## Type Casts

Pg can optionally type cast result values and query parameters in Ruby or
native C code. This can speed up data transfers to and from the database,
because String allocations are reduced and conversions in (slower) Ruby code
can be omitted.

Very basic type casting can be enabled by:
```ruby
    conn.type_map_for_results = PG::BasicTypeMapForResults.new conn
    # ... this works for result value mapping:
    conn.exec("select 1, now(), '{2,3}'::int[]").values
        # => [[1, 2014-09-21 20:51:56 +0200, [2, 3]]]

    conn.type_map_for_queries = PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries.new conn
    # ... and this for param value mapping:
    conn.exec_params("SELECT $1::text, $2::text, $3::text", [1, 1.23, [2,3]]).values
        # => [["1", "1.2300000000000000E+00", "{2,3}"]]
```

But Pg's type casting is highly customizable. That's why it's divided into
2 layers:

### Encoders / Decoders (ext/pg_\*coder.c, lib/pg/\*coder.rb)

This is the lower layer, containing encoding classes that convert Ruby
objects for transmission to the DBMS and decoding classes to convert
received data back to Ruby objects. The classes are namespaced according
to their format and direction in PG::TextEncoder, PG::TextDecoder,
PG::BinaryEncoder and PG::BinaryDecoder.

It is possible to assign a type OID, format code (text or binary) and
optionally a name to an encoder or decoder object. It's also possible
to build composite types by assigning an element encoder/decoder.
PG::Coder objects can be used to set up a PG::TypeMap or alternatively
to convert single values to/from their string representation.

The following PostgreSQL column types are supported by ruby-pg (TE = Text Encoder, TD = Text Decoder, BE = Binary Encoder, BD = Binary Decoder):

* Integer: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Integer), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Integer), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::Integer) ðŸ’¡ No links? Switch to [here](https://deveiate.org/code/pg/README_md.html#label-Type+Casts) ðŸ’¡
    * BE: [Int2](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Int2), [Int4](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Int4), [Int8](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Int8)
* Float: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Float), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Float), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::Float)
    * BE: [Float4](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Float4), [Float8](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Float8)
* Numeric: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Numeric), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Numeric)
* Boolean: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Boolean), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Boolean), [BE](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Boolean), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::Boolean)
* String: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::String), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::String), [BE](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::String), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::String)
* Bytea: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Bytea), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Bytea), [BE](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Bytea), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::Bytea)
* Base64: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::ToBase64), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::FromBase64), [BE](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::FromBase64), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::ToBase64)
* Timestamp:
    * TE: [local](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::TimestampWithoutTimeZone), [UTC](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::TimestampUtc), [with-TZ](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::TimestampWithTimeZone)
    * TD: [local](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::TimestampLocal), [UTC](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::TimestampUtc), [UTC-to-local](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::TimestampUtcToLocal)
    * BE: [local](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::TimestampLocal), [UTC](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::TimestampUtc)
    * BD: [local](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::TimestampLocal), [UTC](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::TimestampUtc), [UTC-to-local](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::TimestampUtcToLocal)
* Date: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Date), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Date), [BE](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Date), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::Date)
* JSON and JSONB: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::JSON), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::JSON)
* Inet: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Inet), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Inet)
* Array: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Array), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Array), [BE](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::Array), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::Array)
* Composite Type (also called "Row" or "Record"): [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Record), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Record)

The following text and binary formats can also be encoded although they are not used as column type:

* COPY input and output data: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::CopyRow), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::CopyRow), [BE](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryEncoder::CopyRow), [BD](rdoc-ref:PG::BinaryDecoder::CopyRow)
* Literal for insertion into SQL string: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::QuotedLiteral)
* SQL-Identifier: [TE](rdoc-ref:PG::TextEncoder::Identifier), [TD](rdoc-ref:PG::TextDecoder::Identifier)

### TypeMap and derivations (ext/pg_type_map\*.c, lib/pg/type_map\*.rb)

A PG::TypeMap defines which value will be converted by which encoder/decoder.
There are different type map strategies, implemented by several derivations
of this class. They can be chosen and configured according to the particular
needs for type casting. The default type map is PG::TypeMapAllStrings.

A type map can be assigned per connection or per query respectively per
result set. Type maps can also be used for COPY in and out data streaming.
See PG::Connection#copy_data .

The following base type maps are available:

* PG::TypeMapAllStrings - encodes and decodes all values to and from strings (default)
* PG::TypeMapByClass - selects encoder based on the class of the value to be sent
* PG::TypeMapByColumn - selects encoder and decoder by column order
* PG::TypeMapByOid - selects decoder by PostgreSQL type OID
* PG::TypeMapInRuby - define a custom type map in ruby

The following type maps are prefilled with type mappings from the PG::BasicTypeRegistry :

* PG::BasicTypeMapForResults - a PG::TypeMapByOid prefilled with decoders for common PostgreSQL column types
* PG::BasicTypeMapBasedOnResult - a PG::TypeMapByOid prefilled with encoders for common PostgreSQL column types
* PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries - a PG::TypeMapByClass prefilled with encoders for common Ruby value classes

Several type maps can be chained by setting PG::TypeMap::DefaultTypeMappable#default_type_map .

## Thread support

PG is thread safe in such a way that different threads can use different PG::Connection objects concurrently.
However it is not safe to access any Pg objects simultaneously from more than one thread.
So make sure to open a new database server connection for every new thread or use a wrapper library like ActiveRecord that manages connections in a thread safe way.

If messages like the following are printed to stderr, you're probably using one connection from several threads:

    message type 0x31 arrived from server while idle
    message type 0x32 arrived from server while idle
    message type 0x54 arrived from server while idle
    message type 0x43 arrived from server while idle
    message type 0x5a arrived from server while idle


## Fiber IO scheduler support

Pg is fully compatible with `Fiber.scheduler` introduced in Ruby-3.0 since pg-1.3.0.
On Windows support for `Fiber.scheduler` is available on Ruby-3.1 or newer.
All possibly blocking IO operations are routed through the `Fiber.scheduler` if one is registered for the running thread.
That is why pg internally uses the asynchronous libpq interface even for synchronous/blocking method calls.
It also uses Ruby's DNS resolution instead of libpq's builtin functions.

Internally Pg always uses the nonblocking connection mode of libpq.
It then behaves like running in blocking mode but ensures, that all blocking IO is handled in Ruby through a possibly registered `Fiber.scheduler`.
When `PG::Connection.setnonblocking(true)` is called then the nonblocking state stays enabled, but the additional handling of blocking states is disabled, so that the calling program has to handle blocking states on its own.

An exception to this rule are the methods for large objects like `PG::Connection#lo_create` and authentication methods using external libraries (like GSSAPI authentication).
They are not compatible with `Fiber.scheduler`, so that blocking states are not passed to the registered IO scheduler.
That means the operation will work properly, but IO waiting states can not be used to switch to another Fiber doing IO.


## Ractor support

Pg is fully compatible with Ractor introduced in Ruby-3.0 since pg-1.5.0.
All type en/decoders and type maps are shareable between ractors if they are made frozen by `Ractor.make_shareable`.
Also frozen PG::Result and PG::Tuple objects can be shared.
All frozen objects (except PG::Connection) can still be used to do communication with the PostgreSQL server or to read retrieved data.

PG::Connection is not shareable and must be created within each Ractor to establish a dedicated connection.
