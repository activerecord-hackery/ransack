## v1.6.2 [2025-09-02] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Remove several absolute paths from native binaries which pointed to build directories. [#668](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/668)
- Fix bad fallback path to `pg_service.conf`. [#666](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/666)
- Use `rbpg_` prefix for `base64_*` functions to avoid name clashes with functions provided by other libraries like Heimdal on Macos. [#667](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/667)
- Raise a more descriptive error message in case of `pg_ext` LoadError. [#664](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/664)
- Freeze some constants to make them available in a Ractor context. [#660](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/660)
- Several documentation improvements.
- Update native binary gems to OpenSSL-3.5.2, krb5-1.22.1 and PostgreSQL-17.6.


## v1.6.1 [2025-08-03] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Add binary gems for platforms `aarch64-linux-musl` and `x86_64-linux-musl` without the need to install package `gcompat`. [#657](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/657).
- Serialize CompositeCoder#dimensions only when set. [#652](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/652)
  This fixes the compatibility to pg-1.5.9, when deserializing Marshal data from pg-1.6, as long as the new attribute isn't used.
- Remove dependency to MSYS2 package "postgresql" from binary Windows gem [#654](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/654)


## v1.6.0 [2025-07-27] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

Added:

- Add binary gems for Ruby 3.4.
- Add fat binary gem for platform `aarch64-mingw-ucrt` aka Windows on ARM [#626](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/626), for platform Macos on Intel and ARM [#643](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/643), for platform `aarch64-linux` [#646](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/646) and for platform `x86_64-linux` [#551](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/551#issuecomment-2504715762).
- Update fat binary gem to OpenSSL-3.5.1 and PostgreSQL-17.5.
- Add a patch to libpq to avoid starvation on bigger SSL records, which some database engines other than vanilla PostgreSQL use.
  This patch applies to platform specific binary gems only.
  [#616](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/616)
- Add support for new query cancel functions of PostgreSQL-17.
  This adds the new class `PG::CancelConnection` which provides the ability to cancel a query per blocking or per non-blocking functions.
  If the new functions are available they are used and the older are no longer compiled in.
  This way we can get rid of reading out the internal `PGcancel` struct by `Connection#backend_key`.
  [#614](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/614)
- Add PG::BinaryDecoder::Array and PG::BinaryEncoder::Array to parse and encode PostgreSQL arrays in binary format.
  [#603](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/603)
- Add possibility to define the number of array dimensions to be encoded.
  Setting dimensions is especially useful, when a Record shall be encoded into an Array, since the Array encoder can not distinguish if the array shall be encoded as a higher dimension or as a record otherwise.
  [#622](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/622)
- Add Connection#set_chunked_rows_mode [#610](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/610)
- Add PG::Connection#close_prepared, PG::Connection#close_portal, PG::Connection#send_close_prepared and PG::Connection#send_close_portal which are new in PostgreSQL-17.
  [#611](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/611)
- Add Connection#send_pipeline_sync, async_pipeline_sync and release GVL at PQ(sendP|P)ipelineSync.
  [#612](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/612)
- Add MINGW package dependency which is resolved by RubyInstaller.
  [#617](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/617)
- Change `conn.server_version` and `conn.protocol_version` to raise instead of return 0 on error.
  [#632](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/632)
- Fix connecting to multiple hosts after `connnect_timeout`.
  [#637](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/637)
- Fix making PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries shareable for Ractor in ruby-3.5.
  [#636](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/636)
- Fix missing array input verification in PG::TypeMapByColumn.
  This could cause a segfault.
  [#620](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/620)
- Rename `History.md` to `CHANGELOG.md`, which is more common.
  [#642](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/642)

Removed:

- Drop support of Ruby < 2.7 [#606](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/606)
- Drop support of PostgreSQL < 10 [#606](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/606)
- Remove workaround for Truffleruby < 21.3.0 [#613](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/613)


## v1.5.9 [2024-10-24] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Enable thread safety in static OpenSSL build for Windows. [#595](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/595)
- Remove raising `conect_timeout` from 1 to 2 seconds. [#590](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/590)
- Fix binary copy_data in Ractor context. [#594](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/594)
- Exclude CI files and hidden files from built gem. [#591](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/591)
  This is to simplify security inspection.
- Update error classes to PostgreSQL-17.
- Update Windows fat binary gem to OpenSSL-3.4.0 and PostgreSQL-17.0.


## v1.5.8 [2024-09-06] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Fix host list duplication every time conn.reset is used. [#586](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/586)
- Add default decoder for anonymous record types to BasicTypeRegistry [#579](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/579)
- Update Windows fat binary gem to OpenSSL-3.3.2 and PostgreSQL-16.4.


## v1.5.7 [2024-07-28] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

  Direct access is disallowed since ruby-3.4.
- Make `pgconn_connect_poll` close the socket prior to calling `PQconnectPoll`. [#564](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/564)
  This could result in an exception while connecting when used multi threaded.
- Fix several typos and improve spelling in documentation and code. [#566](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/566)
- Add missing PG::RollbackTransaction as an option to exit conn.transaction. [#560](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/560)
  Usage like in rails: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Rollback.html
- Don't print a warning when bigdecimal is required on ruby-3.4+ [#574](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/574)
- Update Windows fat binary gem to OpenSSL-3.3.1 and PostgreSQL-16.3.


## v1.5.6 [2024-03-01] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Renew address resolution (DNS) in conn.reset. [#558](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/558)
  This is important, if DNS is used for load balancing, etc.
- Make bigdecimal an optional dependency. [#556](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/556)
  It's a gem in ruby-3.4+, so that users shouldn't be forced to use it.


## v1.5.5 [2024-02-15] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Explicitly retype timespec fields to int64_t to fix compatibility with 32bit arches. [#547](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/547)

- Fix compiling the pg extension with MSVC 2022. [#535](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/535)
- Set PG::Connection's encoding even if setting client_encoding on connection startup fails. [#541](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/541)
- Don't set the server's client_encoding if it's unnecessary. [#542](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/542)
  This is important for connection proxies, who disallow configuration settings.
- Update Windows fat binary gem to OpenSSL-3.1.2 and PostgreSQL-15.4.


## v1.5.3 [2023-04-28] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Fix possible segfault when creating a new PG::Result with type map. [#530](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/530)
- Add category to deprecation warnings of Coder.new, so that they are suppressed for most users. [#528](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/528)


## v1.5.2 [2023-04-26] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Fix regression in copy_data regarding binary format when using no coder. [#527](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/527)


## v1.5.1 [2023-04-24] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Don't overwrite flags of timestamp coders. [#524](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/524)
  Fixes a regression in rails: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/48049


## v1.5.0 [2023-04-24] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

Enhancements:

- Better support for binary format:
    - Extend PG::Connection#copy_data to better support binary transfers [#511](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/511)
    - Add binary COPY encoder and decoder:
        * PG::BinaryEncoder::CopyRow
        * PG::BinaryDecoder::CopyRow
    - Add binary timestamp encoders:
        * PG::BinaryEncoder::TimestampUtc
        * PG::BinaryEncoder::TimestampLocal
        * PG::BinaryEncoder::Timestamp
    - Add PG::BinaryEncoder::Float4 and Float8
    - Add binary date type: [#515](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/515)
        * PG::BinaryEncoder::Date
        * PG::BinaryDecoder::Date
    - Add PG::Result#binary_tuples [#511](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/511)
      It is useful for COPY and not deprecated in that context.
    - Add PG::TextEncoder::Bytea to BasicTypeRegistry [#506](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/506)
- Ractor support: [#519](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/519)
    - Pg is now fully compatible with Ractor introduced in Ruby-3.0 and doesn't use any global mutable state.
    - All type en/decoders and type maps are shareable between ractors if they are made frozen by `Ractor.make_shareable`.
    - Also frozen PG::Result and PG::Tuple objects can be shared.
    - All frozen objects (except PG::Connection) can still be used to do communication with the PostgreSQL server or to read retrieved data.
    - PG::Connection is not shareable and must be created within each Ractor to establish a dedicated connection.
- Use keyword arguments instead of hashes for Coder initialization and #to_h. [#511](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/511)
- Add PG::Result.res_status as a class method and extend Result#res_status to return the status of self. [#508](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/508)
- Reduce the number of files loaded at `require 'pg'` by using autoload. [#513](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/513)
  Previously stdlib libraries `date`, `json`, `ipaddr` and `bigdecimal` were static dependencies, but now only `socket` is mandatory.
- Improve garbage collector performance by adding write barriers to all PG classes. [#518](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/518)
  Now they can be promoted to the old generation, which means they only get marked on major GC.
- New method PG::Connection#check_socket to check the socket state. [#521](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/521)
- Mark many internal constants as private. [#522](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/522)
- Update Windows fat binary gem to OpenSSL-3.1.0.

Bugfixes:

- Move nfields-check of stream-methods after result status check [#507](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/507)
  This ensures that the nfield-check doesn't hide errors like statement timeout.

Removed:

- Remove deprecated PG::BasicTypeRegistry.register_type and co. [Part of #519](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/commit/2919ee1a0c6b216e18e1d06c95c2616ef69d2f97)
- Add deprecation warning about PG::Coder initialization per Hash argument. [#514](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/514)
  It is recommended to use keyword arguments instead.
- The internal encoding cache was removed. [#516](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/516)
  It shouldn't have a practical performance impact.

Repository:

- `rake test` tries to find PostgreSQL server commands by pg_config [#503](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/503)
  So there's no need to set the PATH manually any longer.


## v1.4.6 [2023-02-26] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Add japanese README file. [#502](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/502)
- Improve `discard_results` to not block under memory pressure. [#500](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/500)
- Use a dedicated error class `PG::LostCopyState` for errors due to another query within `copy_data` and mention that it's probably due to another query.
  Previously the "no COPY in progress" `PG::Error` was less specific. [#499](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/499)
- Make sure an error in `put_copy_end` of `copy_data`  doesn't lose the original exception.
- Disable nonblocking mode while large object calls. [#498](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/498)
  Since pg-1.3.0 libpq's "lo_*" calls failed when a bigger amount of data was transferred.
  This specifically forced the `active_storage-postgresql` gem to use pg-1.2.3.
- Add rdoc options to gemspec, so that "gem install" generates complete offline documentation.
- Add binary Windows gems for Ruby 3.2.
- Update Windows fat binary gem to PostgreSQL-15.2 and OpenSSL-3.0.8.


## v1.4.5 [2022-11-17] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Fix name resolution when empty or `nil` port is given.
- Update error codes to PostgreSQL-15.
- Update Windows fat binary gem to PostgreSQL-15.1 AND OpenSSL-1.1.1s.


## v1.4.4 [2022-10-11] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

  Ensure that parameter `connect_timeout` is still respected.
- Handle multiple hosts in the connection string, where only one host has writable session. [#476](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/476)
- Add some useful information to PG::Connection#inspect. [#487](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/487)
- Support new pgresult_stream_any API in sequel_pg-1.17.0. [#481](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/481)
- Update Windows fat binary gem to PostgreSQL-14.5.


## v1.4.3 [2022-08-09] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

- Avoid memory bloat possible in put_copy_data in pg-1.4.0 to 1.4.2. [#473](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/473)
- Use Encoding::BINARY for JOHAB, removing some useless code. [#472](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/472)


## v1.4.2 [2022-07-27] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

Bugfixes:

- Update Windows fat binary gem to OpenSSL-1.1.1o and PostgreSQL-14.4.

Enhancements:

- Don't flush at each put_copy_data call, but flush at get_result. [#462](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/462)


## v1.3.5 [2022-03-31] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

Bugfixes:

- Handle PGRES_COMMAND_OK in pgresult_stream_any. [#447](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/447)
  Fixes usage when trying to stream the result of a procedure call that returns no results.

Enhancements:

- Rename BasicTypeRegistry#define_default_types to #register_default_types to use a more consistent terminology.
  Keeping define_default_types for compatibility.
- BasicTypeRegistry: return self instead of objects by accident.
  This allows call chaining.
- Add some April fun. [#449](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/449)

Documentation:
- Refine documentation of conn.socket_io and conn.connect_poll


## v1.3.4 [2022-03-10] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

Bugfixes:

- Don't leak IO in case of connection errors. [#439](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/439)
  Previously it was kept open until the PG::Connection was garbage collected.
- Fix a performance regression in conn.get_result noticed in single row mode. [#442](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/442)
- Fix occasional error Errno::EBADF (Bad file descriptor) while connecting. [#444](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/444)

Enhancements:

- Allow pgresult_stream_any to be used by sequel_pg. [#443](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/443)


## v1.3.3 [2022-02-22] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

Bugfixes:

- Fix omission of the third digit of IPv4 addresses in connection URI. [#435](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/435)

## v1.3.2 [2022-02-14] Lars Kanis <lars@greiz-reinsdorf.de>

Bugfixes:

- Cancel only active query after failing transaction. [#430](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/430)
  This avoids an incompatibility with pgbouncer since pg-1.3.0.
- Fix String objects with non-applied encoding when using COPY or record decoders. [#427](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/427)
- Update Windows fat binary gem to PostgreSQL-14.2.

Enhancements:

- Add a check for PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC, to make sure the library version and the header files are PostgreSQL-14+. [#429](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/429)


## v1.3.1 [2022-02-01] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Bugfixes:

- Fix wrong handling of socket writability on Windows introduced in [#417](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/417).
  This caused starvation in conn.put_copy_data.
- Fix error in PG.version_string(true). [#419](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/419)
- Fix a regression in pg 1.3.0 where Ruby 2.x busy-looping any fractional seconds for every wait. [#420](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/420)

Enhancements:

- Raise an error when conn.copy_data is used in nonblocking mode.


## v1.3.0 [2022-01-20] Michael Granger <ged@FaerieMUD.org>

Install Enhancements:
- Print some install help if libpq wasn't found. [#396](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/396)
  This should help to pick the necessary package without googling.
- Update Windows fat binary gem to OpenSSL-1.1.1m and PostgreSQL-14.1.
- Add binary Windows gems for Ruby 3.0 and 3.1.
- Make the library path of libpq available in ruby as PG::POSTGRESQL_LIB_PATH and add it to the search paths on Windows similar to +rpath+ on Unix systems. [#373](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/373)
- Fall back to pkg-config if pg_config is not found. [#380](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/380)
- Add option to extconf.rb to disable nogvl-wrapping of libpq functions.
  All methods (except PG::Connection.ping) are nonblocking now, so that GVL unlock is in theory no longer necessary.
  However it can have some advantage in concurrency, so that GVL unlock is still enabled by default.
  Use:
  - gem inst pg -- --disable-gvl-unlock

API Enhancements:
- Add full compatibility to Fiber.scheduler introduced in Ruby-3.0. [#397](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/397)
  - Add async_connect and async_send methods and add specific specs for Fiber.scheduler [#342](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/342)
  - Add async_get_result and async_get_last_result
  - Add async_get_copy_data
  - Implement async_put_copy_data/async_put_copy_end
  - Implement async_reset method using the nonblocking libpq API
  - Add async_set_client_encoding which is compatible to scheduler
  - Add async_cancel as a nonblocking version of conn#cancel
  - Add async_encrypt_password
  - Run Connection.ping in a second thread.
  - Make discard_results scheduler friendly
  - Do all socket waiting through the conn.socket_io object.
  - Avoid PG.connect blocking while address resolution by automatically providing the +hostaddr+ parameter and resolving in Ruby instead of libpq.
  - On Windows Fiber.scheduler support requires Ruby-3.1+.
    It is also only partly usable since may ruby IO methods are not yet scheduler aware on Windows.
- Add support for pipeline mode of PostgreSQL-14. [#401](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/401)
- Allow specification of multiple hosts in PostgreSQL URI. [#387](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/387)
- Add new method conn.backend_key - used to implement our own cancel method.

Type cast enhancements:
- Add PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries::BinaryData for encoding of bytea columns. [#348](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/348)
- Reduce time to build coder maps and permit to reuse them for several type maps per PG::BasicTypeRegistry::CoderMapsBundle.new(conn) . [#376](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/376)
- Make BasicTypeRegistry a class and use a global default instance of it.
  Now a local type registry can be instantiated and given to the type map, to avoid changing shared global states.
- Allow PG::BasicTypeMapForQueries to take a Proc as callback for undefined types.

Other Enhancements:
- Convert all PG classes implemented in C to TypedData objects. [#349](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/349)
- Support ObjectSpace.memsize_of(obj) on all classes implemented in C. [#393](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/393)
- Make all PG objects implemented in C memory moveable and therefore GC.compact friendly. [#349](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg/pull/349)
- Update errorcodes and error classes to PostgreSQL-14.0.
- Add PG::CONNECTION_* constants for conn.status of newer PostgreSQL versions.
