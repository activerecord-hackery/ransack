## 1.7.3 / 2024-03-15

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.45.2](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_2.html). @flavorjones


## 1.7.2 / 2024-01-30

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.45.1](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_1.html). @flavorjones


## 1.7.1 / 2024-01-24

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.45.0](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_45_0.html). @flavorjones


## 1.7.0 / 2023-12-27

### Ruby

This release introduces native gem support for Ruby 3.3.

This release ends native gem support for Ruby 2.7, for which [upstream support ended 2023-03-31](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/). Ruby 2.7 is still generally supported, but will not be shipped in the native gems.

This release ends support for Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.

### Improved

- SQLite3::Statement, Database, and Backup objects have been converted to use the TypedData API. See https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19998 for more context. [#432] @casperisfine


## 1.6.9 / 2023-11-26

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is update to [v3.44.2](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_44_2.html). @flavorjones

### Added

- `Database.new` now accepts a `:default_transaction_mode` option (defaulting to `:deferred`), and `Database#transaction` no longer requires a transaction mode to be specified. This should allow higher-level adapters to more easily choose a transaction mode for a database connection. [#426] @masamitsu-murase


## 1.6.8 / 2023-11-01

### Dependencies

- Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.44.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_44_0.html). @flavorjones
- rake-compiler-dock updated to v1.3.1 for precompiled native gems. @flavorjones


### Added

- `SQLite3::Database.open` now returns the block result. Previously this returned the Database object. [#415] @toy
- Documentation improvement in `lib/sqlite3/database.rb`. [#421] @szTheory


## 1.6.7 / 2023-10-10

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.43.2](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_43_2.html).

Upstream release notes:

> - Fix a couple of obscure UAF errors and an obscure memory leak.
> - Omit the use of the sprintf() function from the standard library in the [CLI](https://sqlite.org/cli.html), as this now generates warnings on some platforms.
> - Avoid conversion of a double into unsigned long long integer, as some platforms do not do such conversions correctly.


### Added

* Compile packaged sqlite3 with additional flags to explicitly enable FTS5, and set synchronous mode to normal when in WAL mode. [#408] (@flavorjones)


## 1.6.6 / 2023-09-12

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.43.1](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_43_1.html).

Upstream release notes:

> - Fix a regression in the way that the [sum()](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#sumunc), [avg()](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#avg), and [total()](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#sumunc) aggregate functions handle infinities.
> - Fix a bug in the [json_array_length()](https://sqlite.org/json1.html#jarraylen) function that occurs when the argument comes directly from [json_remove()](https://sqlite.org/json1.html#jrm).
> - Fix the omit-unused-subquery-columns optimization (introduced in in version 3.42.0) so that it works correctly if the subquery is a compound where one arm is DISTINCT and the other is not.
> - Other minor fixes.


## 1.6.5 / 2023-09-08

### Packaging

* Allow setting compiler flags for the sqlite library via a `--with-sqlite-cflags` argument to `extconf.rb`. See [`INSTALLATION.md`](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md#controlling-compilation-flags-for-sqlite) for more information. [#401, #402] (@flavorjones)


## 1.6.4 / 2023-08-26

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.43.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_43_0.html).

Upstream release notes:

> SQLite Release 3.43.0 On 2023-08-24
> * Add support for Contentless-Delete FTS5 Indexes. This is a variety of FTS5 full-text search index that omits storing the content that is being indexed while also allowing records to be deleted.
> * Enhancements to the date and time functions:
>   * Added new time shift modifiers of the form Â±YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS.
>   * Added the timediff() SQL function.
> * Added the octet_length(X) SQL function.
> * Added the sqlite3_stmt_explain() API.
> * Query planner enhancements:
>   * Generalize the LEFT JOIN strength reduction optimization so that it works for RIGHT and FULL JOINs as well. Rename it to OUTER JOIN strength reduction.
>   * Enhance the theorem prover in the OUTER JOIN strength reduction optimization so that it returns fewer false-negatives.
> * Enhancements to the decimal extension:
>   * New function decimal_pow2(N) returns the N-th power of 2 for integer N between -20000 and +20000.
>   * New function decimal_exp(X) works like decimal(X) except that it returns the result in exponential notation - with a "e+NN" at the end.
>   * If X is a floating-point value, then the decimal(X) function now does a full expansion of that value into its exact decimal equivalent.
> * Performance enhancements to JSON processing results in a 2x performance improvement for some kinds of processing on large JSON strings.
> * New makefile target "verify-source" checks to ensure that there are no unintentional changes in the source tree. (Works for canonical source code only - not for precompiled amalgamation tarballs.)
> * Added the SQLITE_USE_SEH compile-time option that enables Structured Exception Handling on Windows while working with the memory-mapped shm file that is part of WAL mode processing. This option is enabled by default when building on Windows using Makefile.msc.
> * The VFS for unix now assumes that the nanosleep() system call is available unless compiled with -DHAVE_NANOSLEEP=0.


## 1.6.3 / 2023-05-16

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.42.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_42_0.html).

From the release announcement:

> This is a regular enhancement release.  The main new features are:
> * SQLite will now parse and understand JSON5, though it is careful to generate only pure, canonical JSON.
> * The secure-delete option has been added to the FTS5 extension.


## 1.6.2 / 2023-03-27

### Dependencies

Vendored sqlite is updated from v3.41.0 to [v3.41.2](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_41_2.html).


### Packaging

* Allow compilation against system libraries without the presence of `mini_portile2`, primarily for the convenience of linux distro repackagers. [#381] (Thank you, @voxik!)


## 1.6.1 / 2023-02-22

### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.41.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_41_0.html).


## 1.6.0 / 2023-01-13

### Ruby

This release introduces native gem support for Ruby 3.2.

This release ends native gem support for Ruby 2.6, for which [upstream support ended 2022-04-12](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).


### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite3 is updated to [v3.40.1](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_40_1.html).


### Fixes

* `get_boolean_pragma` now returns the correct value. Previously, it always returned true. [#275] (Thank you, @Edouard-chin!)


## 1.5.4 / 2022-11-18

### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.40.0](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_40_0.html).


## 1.5.3 / 2022-10-11

### Fixed

* Fixed installation of the "ruby" platform gem when building from source on Fedora. In v1.5.0..v1.5.2, installation failed on some systems due to the behavior of Fedora's pkg-config implementation. [#355]


## 1.5.2 / 2022-10-01

### Packaging

This version correctly vendors the tarball for sqlite v3.39.4 in the vanilla "ruby" platform gem package, so that users will not require network access at installation.

v1.5.0 and v1.5.1 mistakenly packaged the tarball for sqlite v3.38.5 in the vanilla "ruby" platform gem, resulting in downloading the intended tarball over the network at installation time (or, if the network was not available, failure to install). Note that the precompiled native gems were not affected by this issue. [#352]


## 1.5.1 / 2022-09-29

### Dependencies

* Vendored sqlite is updated to [v3.39.4](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_4.html).

### Security

The vendored version of sqlite, v3.39.4, should be considered to be a security release. From the release notes:

> Version 3.39.4 is a minimal patch against the prior release that addresses issues found since the
> prior release. In particular, a potential vulnerability in the FTS3 extension has been fixed, so
> this should be considered a security update.
>
> In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have full SQL access and must be able to
> construct a corrupt database with over 2GB of FTS3 content. The problem arises from a 32-bit
> signed integer overflow.

## 1.5.0 / 2022-09-08

### Packaging

#### Faster, more reliable installation

Native (precompiled) gems are available for Ruby 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, and 3.1 on all these platforms:

- `aarch64-linux`
- `arm-linux`
- `arm64-darwin`
- `x64-mingw32` and `x64-mingw-ucrt`
- `x86-linux`
- `x86_64-darwin`
- `x86_64-linux`

If you are using one of these Ruby versions on one of these platforms, the native gem is the recommended way to install sqlite3-ruby.

See [the README](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby#native-gems-recommended) for more information.


#### More consistent developer experience

Both the native (precompiled) gems and the vanilla "ruby platform" (source) gem include sqlite v3.39.3 by default.

Defaulting to a consistent version of sqlite across all systems means that your development environment behaves exactly like your production environment, and you have access to the latest and greatest features of sqlite.

You can opt-out of the packaged version of sqlite (and use your system-installed library as in versions < 1.5.0). See [the README](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby#avoiding-the-precompiled-native-gem) for more information.
