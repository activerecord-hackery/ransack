Byebug is a simple to use and feature rich debugger for Ruby. It uses the
TracePoint API for execution control and the Debug Inspector API for call stack
navigation. Therefore, Byebug doesn't depend on internal core sources. Byebug is also
fast because it is developed as a C extension and reliable because it is supported
by a full test suite.

The debugger permits the ability to understand what is going on _inside_ a Ruby program
while it executes and offers many of the traditional debugging features such as:

* Stepping: Running your program one line at a time.
* Breaking: Pausing the program at some event or specified instruction, to
  examine the current state.
* Evaluating: Basic REPL functionality, although [pry] does a better job at
  that.
* Tracking: Keeping track of the different values of your variables or the
  different lines executed by your program.

## For enterprise

Byebug for enterprise is available via the Tidelift Subscription. [Learn

## Build Status

![ubuntu](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/workflows/ubuntu/badge.svg)
![windows](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/workflows/windows/badge.svg)

## Requirements

* _Required_: MRI 3.1.0 or higher.

## Install

```shell
gem install byebug
```

Alternatively, if you use `bundler`:

```shell
bundle add byebug --group "development, test"
```

## Usage

### From within the Ruby code

Simply include `byebug` wherever you want to start debugging and the execution will
stop there. For example, if you were debugging Rails, you would add `byebug` to
your code:

```ruby
def index
  byebug
  @articles = Article.find_recent
end
```

And then start a Rails server:

```shell
bin/rails s
```

Once the execution gets to your `byebug` command, you will receive a debugging prompt.

### From the command line

If you want to debug a Ruby script without editing it, you can invoke byebug from the command line.

```shell
byebug myscript.rb
```
