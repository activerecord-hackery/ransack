# ![Rack](contrib/logo.webp)

Rack provides a minimal, modular, and adaptable interface for developing web
applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest
way possible, it unifies and distills the bridge between web servers, web
frameworks, and web application into a single method call.

The exact details of this are described in the [Rack Specification], which all
Rack applications should conform to. Browse the [Documentation] for more
information.

## Change log

See the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed list of changes in each version of Rack.

### Rack 3.2 (latest release)

This version of rack contains bug fixes and security patches.

### Rack 3.1

This version of rack contains bug fixes and security patches.

### Rack 3.0

This version of rack contains significant changes which are detailed in the
[Upgrade Guide](UPGRADE-GUIDE.md). It is recommended to upgrade to Rack 3 as soon
as possible to receive the latest features and security patches.

### Rack 2.2

This version of Rack is receiving security patches only, and effort should be
made to move to Rack 3.

Starting in Ruby 3.4 the `base64` dependency will no longer be a default gem,
and may cause a warning or error about `base64` being missing. To correct this,
add `base64` as a dependency to your project.

## Installation

Add the rack gem to your application bundle, or follow the instructions provided
by a [supported web framework](#supported-web-frameworks):

```bash
# Install it generally:
$ gem install rack

# or, add it to your current application gemfile:
$ bundle add rack
```

If you need features from `Rack::Session` or `bin/rackup` please add those gems separately.

```bash
$ gem install rack-session rackup
```

## Usage

Create a file called `config.ru` with the following contents:

```ruby
run do |env|
  [200, {}, ["Hello World"]]
end
```

Run this using the rackup gem or another [supported web
server](#supported-web-servers).

```bash
$ gem install rackup
$ rackup

# In another shell:
$ curl http://localhost:9292
Hello World
```

## Supported web servers

Rack is supported by a wide range of servers, including:

* [Agoo](https://github.com/ohler55/agoo)
* [Falcon](https://github.com/socketry/falcon)
* [Iodine](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine)
* [NGINX Unit](https://unit.nginx.org/)
* [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) (which is mod_rack for
  Apache and for nginx)
* [Pitchfork](https://github.com/Shopify/pitchfork)
* [Puma](https://puma.io/)
* [Thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin)
* [Unicorn](https://yhbt.net/unicorn/)
* [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Lamby](https://lamby.custominktech.com) (for AWS Lambda)

You will need to consult the server documentation to find out what features and
limitations they may have. In general, any valid Rack app will run the same on
all these servers, without changing anything.

### Rackup

Rack provides a separate gem, [rackup](https://github.com/rack/rackup) which is
a generic interface for running a Rack application on supported servers, which
include `WEBRick`, `Puma`, `Falcon` and others.

## Supported web frameworks

These frameworks and many others support the [Rack Specification]:

* [Camping](https://github.com/camping/camping)
* [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/)
* [Ramaze](https://github.com/ramaze/ramaze)
* [Padrino](https://padrinorb.com/)
* [Roda](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Rum](https://github.com/leahneukirchen/rum)
* [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/)
* [Utopia](https://github.com/socketry/utopia)
* [WABuR](https://github.com/ohler55/wabur)

## Available middleware shipped with Rack

Between the server and the framework, Rack can be customized to your
applications needs using middleware. Rack itself ships with the following
middleware:

* `Rack::CommonLogger` for creating Apache-style logfiles.
* `Rack::ConditionalGet` for returning [Not
  Modified](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304)
  responses when the response has not changed.
* `Rack::Config` for modifying the environment before processing the request.
* `Rack::ContentLength` for setting a `content-length` header based on body
  size.
* `Rack::ContentType` for setting a default `content-type` header for responses.
* `Rack::Deflater` for compressing responses with gzip.
* `Rack::ETag` for setting `etag` header on bodies that can be buffered.
* `Rack::Events` for providing easy hooks when a request is received and when
  the response is sent.
* `Rack::Head` for returning an empty body for HEAD requests.
* `Rack::Lint` for checking conformance to the [Rack Specification].
* `Rack::Lock` for serializing requests using a mutex.
* `Rack::MethodOverride` for modifying the request method based on a submitted
  parameter.
* `Rack::Recursive` for including data from other paths in the application, and
  for performing internal redirects.
* `Rack::Reloader` for reloading files if they have been modified.
* `Rack::Runtime` for including a response header with the time taken to process
  the request.
* `Rack::Sendfile` for working with web servers that can use optimized file
  serving for file system paths.
* `Rack::ShowException` for catching unhandled exceptions and presenting them in
  a nice and helpful way with clickable backtrace.
* `Rack::ShowStatus` for using nice error pages for empty client error
  responses.
* `Rack::Static` for configurable serving of static files.
* `Rack::TempfileReaper` for removing temporary files creating during a request.

All these components use the same interface, which is described in detail in the
[Rack Specification]. These optional components can be used in any way you wish.

### Convenience interfaces

If you want to develop outside of existing frameworks, implement your own ones,
or develop middleware, Rack provides many helpers to create Rack applications
quickly and without doing the same web stuff all over:

* `Rack::Request` which also provides query string parsing and multipart
  handling.
* `Rack::Response` for convenient generation of HTTP replies and cookie
  handling.
* `Rack::MockRequest` and `Rack::MockResponse` for efficient and quick testing
  of Rack application without real HTTP round-trips.
* `Rack::Cascade` for trying additional Rack applications if an application
  returns a not found or method not supported response.
* `Rack::Directory` for serving files under a given directory, with directory
  indexes.
* `Rack::Files` for serving files under a given directory, without directory
  indexes.
* `Rack::MediaType` for parsing content-type headers.
* `Rack::Mime` for determining content-type based on file extension.
* `Rack::RewindableInput` for making any IO object rewindable, using a temporary
  file buffer.
* `Rack::URLMap` to route to multiple applications inside the same process.

## Configuration

Rack exposes several configuration parameters to control various features of the
implementation.

### `RACK_QUERY_PARSER_BYTESIZE_LIMIT`

This environment variable sets the default for the maximum query string bytesize
that `Rack::QueryParser` will attempt to parse.  Attempts to use a query string
that exceeds this number of bytes will result in a
`Rack::QueryParser::QueryLimitError` exception. If this enviroment variable is
provided, it must be an integer, or `Rack::QueryParser` will raise an exception.

The default limit can be overridden on a per-`Rack::QueryParser` basis using
the `bytesize_limit` keyword argument when creating the `Rack::QueryParser`.

### `RACK_QUERY_PARSER_PARAMS_LIMIT`

This environment variable sets the default for the maximum number of query
parameters that `Rack::QueryParser` will attempt to parse.  Attempts to use a
query string with more than this many query parameters will result in a
`Rack::QueryParser::QueryLimitError` exception. If this enviroment variable is
provided, it must be an integer, or `Rack::QueryParser` will raise an exception.

The default limit can be overridden on a per-`Rack::QueryParser` basis using
the `params_limit` keyword argument when creating the `Rack::QueryParser`.

This is implemented by counting the number of parameter separators in the
query string, before attempting parsing, so if the same parameter key is
used multiple times in the query, each counts as a separate parameter for
this check.

### `param_depth_limit`

```ruby
Rack::Utils.param_depth_limit = 32 # default
```

The maximum amount of nesting allowed in parameters. For example, if set to 3,
this query string would be allowed:

```
?a[b][c]=d
```

but this query string would not be allowed:

```
?a[b][c][d]=e
```

Limiting the depth prevents a possible stack overflow when parsing parameters.

### `multipart_file_limit`

```ruby
Rack::Utils.multipart_file_limit = 128 # default
```

The maximum number of parts with a filename a request can contain. Accepting
too many parts can lead to the server running out of file handles.

The default is 128, which means that a single request can't upload more than 128
files at once. Set to 0 for no limit.

Can also be set via the `RACK_MULTIPART_FILE_LIMIT` environment variable.

(This is also aliased as `multipart_part_limit` and `RACK_MULTIPART_PART_LIMIT` for compatibility)

### `multipart_total_part_limit`

The maximum total number of parts a request can contain of any type, including
both file and non-file form fields.

The default is 4096, which means that a single request can't contain more than
4096 parts.

Set to 0 for no limit.

Can also be set via the `RACK_MULTIPART_TOTAL_PART_LIMIT` environment variable.
