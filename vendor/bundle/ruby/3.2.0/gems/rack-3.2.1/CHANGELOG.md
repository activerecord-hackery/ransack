- No changes

## [3.0.0.rc1] - 2022-09-04

### SPEC Changes

- Stream argument must implement `<<` https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1959
- `close` may be called on `rack.input` https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1956
- `rack.response_finished` may be used for executing code after the response has been finished https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1952

## [3.0.0.beta1] - 2022-08-08

### Security

- Do not use semicolon as GET parameter separator. ([#1733](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1733), [@jeremyevans])

### SPEC Changes

- Response array must now be non-frozen.
- Response `status` must now be an integer greater than or equal to 100.
- Response `headers` must now be an unfrozen hash.
- Response header keys can no longer include uppercase characters.
- Response header values can be an `Array` to handle multiple values (and no longer supports `\n` encoded headers).
- Response body can now respond to `#call` (streaming body) instead of `#each` (enumerable body), for the equivalent of response hijacking in previous versions.
- Middleware must no longer call `#each` on the body, but they can call `#to_ary` on the body if it responds to `#to_ary`.
- `rack.input` is no longer required to be rewindable.
- `rack.multithread`/`rack.multiprocess`/`rack.run_once`/`rack.version` are no longer required environment keys.
- `SERVER_PROTOCOL` is now a required environment key, matching the HTTP protocol used in the request.
- `rack.hijack?` (partial hijack) and `rack.hijack` (full hijack) are now independently optional.
- `rack.hijack_io` has been removed completely.
- `rack.response_finished` is an optional environment key which contains an array of callable objects that must accept `#call(env, status, headers, error)` and are invoked after the response is finished (either successfully or unsuccessfully).
- It is okay to call `#close` on `rack.input` to indicate that you no longer need or care about the input.
- The stream argument supplied to the streaming body and hijack must support `#<<` for writing output.

### Removed

- Remove `rack.multithread`/`rack.multiprocess`/`rack.run_once`. These variables generally come too late to be useful. ([#1720](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1720), [@ioquatix], [@jeremyevans]))
- Remove deprecated Rack::Request::SCHEME_WHITELIST. ([@jeremyevans])

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Require `status` to be an Integer. ([#1662](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1662), [@olleolleolle](https://github.com/olleolleolle))
- BREAKING CHANGE: Query parsing now treats parameters without `=` as having the empty string value instead of nil value, to conform to the URL spec. ([#1696](https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/1696), [@jeremyevans])
- Relax validations around `Rack::Request#host` and `Rack::Request#hostname`. ([#1606](https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/1606), [@pvande](https://github.com/pvande))
- Removed antiquated handlers: FCGI, LSWS, SCGI, Thin. ([#1658](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1658), [@ioquatix])
- Removed options from `Rack::Builder.parse_file` and `Rack::Builder.load_file`. ([#1663](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1663), [@ioquatix])

([#1809](https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/1809), [@jeremyevans])
- `Rack::Request.forwarded_authority` (and methods that call it, such as `host`) now returns the last authority in the forwarded header, instead of the first, as earlier forwarded authorities can be forged by clients. This restores the Rack 2.1 behavior. ([#1829](https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/1809), [@jeremyevans])
- Use lower case cookie attributes when creating cookies, and fold cookie attributes to lower case when reading cookies (specifically impacting `secure` and `httponly` attributes). ([#1849](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1849), [@ioquatix])
- The response array must now be mutable (non-frozen) so middleware can modify it without allocating a new Array,therefore reducing object allocations. ([#1887](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1887), [#1927](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1927), [@amatsuda], [@ioquatix])
- `rack.hijack?` (partial hijack) and `rack.hijack` (full hijack) are now independently optional. `rack.hijack_io` is no longer required/specified. ([#1939](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1939), [@ioquatix])

# History/News Archive
Items below this line are from the previously maintained HISTORY.md and NEWS.md files.

## [2.0.0.rc1] 2016-05-06
- Rack::Session::Abstract::ID is deprecated. Please change to use Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted

## [2.0.0.alpha] 2015-12-04
- First-party "SameSite" cookies. Browsers omit SameSite cookies from third-party requests, closing the door on many CSRF attacks.
- Pass `same_site: true` (or `:strict`) to enable: response.set_cookie 'foo', value: 'bar', same_site: true or `same_site: :lax` to use Lax enforcement: response.set_cookie 'foo', value: 'bar', same_site: :lax
- Based on version 7 of the Same-site Cookies internet draft:
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07
- Thanks to Ben Toews (@mastahyeti) and Bob Long (@bobjflong) for updating to drafts 5 and 7.
- Add `Rack::Events` middleware for adding event based middleware: middleware that does not care about the response body, but only cares about doing work at particular points in the request / response lifecycle.
- Add `Rack::Request#authority` to calculate the authority under which the response is being made (this will be handy for h2 pushes).
- Add `Rack::Response::Helpers#cache_control` and `cache_control=`. Use this for setting cache control headers on your response objects.
- Add `Rack::Response::Helpers#etag` and `etag=`.  Use this for setting etag values on the response.
- Introduce `Rack::Response::Helpers#add_header` to add a value to a multi-valued response header. Implemented in terms of other `Response#*_header` methods, so it's available to any response-like class that includes the `Helpers` module.
- Add `Rack::Request#add_header` to match.
- `Rack::Session::Abstract::ID` IS DEPRECATED.  Please switch to `Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted`. `Rack::Session::Abstract::Persisted` uses a request object rather than the `env` hash.
- Pull `ENV` access inside the request object in to a module.  This will help with legacy Request objects that are ENV based but don't want to inherit from Rack::Request
- Move most methods on the `Rack::Request` to a module `Rack::Request::Helpers` and use public API to get values from the request object.  This enables users to mix `Rack::Request::Helpers` in to their own objects so they can implement `(get|set|fetch|each)_header` as they see fit (for example a proxy object).
- Files and directories with + in the name are served correctly. Rather than unescaping paths like a form, we unescape with a URI parser using `Rack::Utils.unescape_path`. Fixes #265
- Tempfiles are automatically closed in the case that there were too
	many posted.
- Added methods for manipulating response headers that don't assume
	they're stored as a Hash. Response-like classes may include the
	Rack::Response::Helpers module if they define these methods:
    - Rack::Response#has_header?
	- Rack::Response#get_header
	- Rack::Response#set_header
	- Rack::Response#delete_header
- Introduce Util.get_byte_ranges that will parse the value of the HTTP_RANGE string passed to it without depending on the `env` hash. `byte_ranges` is deprecated in favor of this method.
- Change Session internals to use Request objects for looking up session information. This allows us to only allocate one request object when dealing with session objects (rather than doing it every time we need to manipulate cookies, etc).
- Add `Rack::Request#initialize_copy` so that the env is duped when the request gets duped.
- Added methods for manipulating request specific data.  This includes
	data set as CGI parameters, and just any arbitrary data the user wants
	to associate with a particular request.  New methods:
	 - Rack::Request#has_header?
	 - Rack::Request#get_header
	 - Rack::Request#fetch_header
	 - Rack::Request#each_header
	 - Rack::Request#set_header
	 - Rack::Request#delete_header
- lib/rack/utils.rb: add a method for constructing "delete" cookie
	headers.  This allows us to construct cookie headers without depending
	on the side effects of mutating a hash.
- Prevent extremely deep parameters from being parsed. CVE-2015-3225
