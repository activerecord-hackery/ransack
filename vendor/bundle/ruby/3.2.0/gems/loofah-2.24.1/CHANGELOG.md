# Changelog

## 2.24.1 / 2025-05-12

### Ruby support

* Import only what's needed from `cgi` for support for Ruby 3.5 #296 @Earlopain


## 2.24.0 / 2024-12-24

### Added

* Built-in scrubber `:double_breakpoint` which sees `<br><br>` and wraps the surrounding content in `<p>` tags. #279, #284 @josecolella @torihuang

### Improved

* Built-in scrubber `:targetblank` now skips `a` tags whose `href` attribute is an anchor link. Previously, all `a` tags were modified to have `target='_blank'`. #291 @fnando


## 2.23.1 / 2024-10-25

### Added

* Allow CSS properties `min-height` and `max-height`. [#288] @lazyatom


## 2.23.0 / 2024-10-24

### Added

* Allow CSS property `min-width`. [#287] @lazyatom


## 2.22.0 / 2023-11-13

### Added

* A `:targetblank` HTML scrubber which ensures all hyperlinks have `target="_blank"`. [#275] @stefannibrasil and @thdaraujo
* A `:noreferrer` HTML scrubber which ensures all hyperlinks have `rel=noreferrer`, similar to the `:nofollow` and `:noopener` scrubbers. [#277] @wynksaiddestroy


## 2.21.4 / 2023-10-10

### Fixed

* `Loofah::HTML5::Scrub.scrub_css` is more consistent in preserving whitespace (and lack of whitespace) in CSS property values. In particular, `.scrub_css` no longer inserts whitespace between tokens that did not already have whitespace between them. [[#273](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/273), fixes [#271](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/271)]


## 2.21.3 / 2023-05-15

### Fixed

* Quash "instance variable not initialized" warning in Ruby < 3.0. [[#268](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/268)] (Thanks, [@dharamgollapudi](https://github.com/dharamgollapudi)!)


## 2.21.2 / 2023-05-11

### Dependencies

* Update the dependency on Nokogiri to be `>= 1.12.0`. The dependency in 2.21.0 and 2.21.1 was left at `>= 1.5.9` but versions before 1.12 would result in a `NameError` exception. [[#266](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/266)]


## 2.21.1 / 2023-05-10

### Fixed

* Don't define `HTML5::Document` and `HTML5::DocumentFragment` when Nokogiri is `< 1.14`. In 2.21.0 these classes were defined whenever `Nokogiri::HTML5` was defined, but Nokogiri v1.12 and v1.13 do not support Loofah subclassing properly.


## 2.21.0 / 2023-05-10

### HTML5 Support

Classes `Loofah::HTML5::Document` and `Loofah::HTML5::DocumentFragment` are introduced, along with helper methods:

- `Loofah.html5_document`
- `Loofah.html5_fragment`
- `Loofah.scrub_html5_document`
- `Loofah.scrub_html5_fragment`

These classes and methods use Nokogiri's HTML5 parser to ensure modern web standards are used.

⚠ HTML5 functionality is only available with Nokogiri v1.14.0 and higher.

⚠ HTML5 functionality is not available for JRuby. Please see [this upstream Nokogiri issue](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2227) if you're interested in helping implement and support HTML5 support.


### `Loofah::HTML4` module and namespace

`Loofah::HTML` has been renamed to `Loofah::HTML4`, and `Loofah::HTML` is aliased to preserve backwards-compatibility. `Nokogiri::HTML` and `Nokogiri::HTML4` parse methods still use libxml2's (or NekoHTML's) HTML4 parser.

Take special note that if you rely on the class name of an object in your code, objects will now report a class of `Loofah::HTML4::Foo` where they previously reported `Loofah::HTML::Foo`. Instead of relying on the string returned by `Object#class`, prefer `Class#===` or `Object#is_a?` or `Object#instance_of?`.

Future releases of Nokogiri may deprecate `HTML` classes and methods or otherwise change this behavior, so please start using `HTML4` in place of `HTML`.


### Official support for JRuby

This version introduces official support for JRuby. Previously, the test suite had never been green due to differences in behavior in the underlying HTML parser used by Nokogiri. We've updated the test suite to accommodate those differences, and have added JRuby to the CI suite.

## 2.2.3 / 2018-10-30

### Security

Address CVE-2018-16468: Unsanitized JavaScript may occur in sanitized output when a crafted SVG element is republished.

This CVE's public notice is at [#154](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/154)


## Meta / 2018-10-27

The mailing list is now on Google Groups [#146](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/146):

## 2.2.2 / 2018-03-22

Make public `Loofah::HTML5::Scrub.force_correct_attribute_escaping!`,

attribute scrubbers should they need to address CVE-2018-8048.

### Bugfixes:

* The :unprintable scrubber now scrubs unprintable characters in CDATA nodes (like `<script>`). [#124](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/124)

## 2.0.3 / 2015-08-17

### Bug fixes:

* Revert support for negative values in CSS properties due to slow performance. [#90](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/90) (Related to [#85](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/85).)

  * attributes: `data-*` (Thanks, Rafael Franca!)
  * URI attributes: `poster` and `preload`
* Addition of the `:unprintable` scrubber to remove unprintable characters from text nodes. [#65](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/65) (Thanks, Matt Swanson!)

### Bug fixes:

## 1.2.1 (2012-04-14)

* Declaring encoding in html5/scrub.rb. Without this, use of the ruby -KU option would cause havoc. ([#32](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/32))


## 1.2.0 (2011-08-08)

### Enhancements:

* Loofah::Helpers.sanitize_css is a replacement for Rails's built-in sanitize_css helper.
* Improving ActionView integration.


## 1.1.0 (2011-08-08)

### Enhancements:

* Additional HTML5lib whitelist elements (from html5lib 1524:80b5efe26230).
  Up to date with HTML5lib ruby code as of 1723:7ee6a0331856.
* Whitelists (which are not part of the public API) are now Sets (were previously Arrays).
* Don't explode when encountering UTF-8 URIs. ([#25](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/25), [#29](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/29))


## 1.0.0 (2010-10-26)

### Notes:

* Moved ActiveRecord functionality into `loofah-activerecord` gem.
* Removed DEPRECATIONS.rdoc documenting 0.3.0 API changes.


## 0.4.7 (2010-03-09)

### Enhancements:

* New methods Loofah::HTML::Document#to_text and
  Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#to_text do the right thing with
  whitespace. Note that these methods are significantly slower than
  #text. GH [#12](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/12)
* Loofah::Elements::BLOCK_LEVEL contains a canonical list of HTML4 block-level4 elements.
* Loofah::HTML::Document#text and Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#text

### Enhancements:

* Loofah::HTML::Document#text and Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment#text now escape HTML entities.

## 0.4.3 (2010-01-29)

### Enhancements:

* All built-in scrubbers are accepted by ActiveRecord::Base.xss_foliate
* Loofah::XssFoliate.xss_foliate_all_models replaces use of the constant LOOFAH_XSS_FOLIATE_ALL_MODELS

### Miscellaneous:

* Modified documentation for bootstrapping XssFoliate in a Rails app,
  since the use of Bundler breaks the previously-documented method. To
  be safe, always use an initializer file.


## 0.4.2 (2010-01-22)

### Enhancements:

* Implemented Node#scrub! for scrubbing subtrees.
* Implemented NodeSet#scrub! for scrubbing a set of subtrees.
* Document.text now only serializes <body> contents (ignores <head>)

## 0.3.0 (2009-10-06)

### Enhancements:

* New ActiveRecord extension `xss_foliate`, a drop-in replacement for xss_terminate[http://github.com/look/xss_terminate/tree/master].
* Replacement methods for Rails's helpers, Loofah::Rails.sanitize and Loofah::Rails.strip_tags.
* Official support (and test coverage) for Rails versions 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 and 1.2.

### Deprecations:

* The methods strip_tags, whitewash, whitewash_document, sanitize, and
  sanitize_document have been deprecated. See DEPRECATED.rdoc for
  details on the equivalent calls with the post-0.2 API.


## 0.2.2 (2009-09-30)

### Enhancements:

* ActiveRecord extension scrubs fields in a before_validation callback
  (was previously in a before_save)


## 0.2.1 (2009-09-19)

  with html_fragment and html_document. GH [#6](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/6) (Thanks Josh Nichols!)

### Bugfixes:

  DocumentFragment objects. GH [#5](https://github.com/flavorjones/loofah/issues/5)
