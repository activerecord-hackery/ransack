# Introduction

Ransack will help you easily add **searching to your Rails application**, without any additional dependencies.

There are advanced searching solutions around, like ElasticSearch or Algolia. **Ransack** will do the job for many Rails websites, without the need to run additional infrastructure or work in a different language. With Ransack you do it all with standard Ruby and ERB.

Ready to move beyond the basics? Use **advanced features** like i18n and extensive configuration options.

Ransack is supported for Rails 7.0, 6.x on Ruby 2.6.6 and later.

## Installation

To install `ransack` and add it to your Gemfile, run

```ruby title='Gemfile'
gem 'ransack'
```

### Bleeding edge

If you would like to use the latest updates not yet published to RubyGems, use the `main` branch:

```ruby title='Gemfile'
gem 'ransack', :github => 'activerecord-hackery/ransack', :branch => 'main'
```

### Demo application

The [Ransack Demo application](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack_demo) shows how to create [simple](http://ransack-demo.herokuapp.com) and
[advanced](http://ransack-demo.herokuapp.com/users/advanced_search) search forms for your Ruby on Rails application.
